This is the official blog for the _Paris Scala User Group_ (PSUG).

Our goal is to bring together users of the [Scala language](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

We invite you to share your experiences, ideas, projects or knowledge.
The group organizes periodic meetings between members and occasionally guests.
You can check the upcoming events in our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Scala-User-Group-PSUG/).

Paris Scala User Group is a partner of [Scala.IO](http://scala.io/) France.

The discussions typically take place at the group's [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/paris-scala-user-group).

Do you have anything to say ? Submit a talk to our [micro-CFP](http://cfp.scala-ug.paris).
